Components  | #

Follow the steps below:

1. First, press fit the machined wheel adaptor into one side of the wheels, ensuring a part of it sticks out.
2. Then press fit the flat metal piece into the opposite side, aligning the three holes.
3. Insert the M3x20mm screws to secure the parts together, as demonstrated in the second image.
4. Using the 2mm Hex wrench screw the set screws that come with the wheel adaptor kit into the wheel adaptors as shown in the 3rd and 4th image.

5. Then you can directly put the wheel on, use the hex key to tight the wheels. Note that it is necessary to leave a bit of space between the wheel and the screw head of the motor, as depicted in the image below, otherwise the wheel hub will rub against the screws holding the motor causing excess friction or jamming the motors.

6. Mount the Wheels to the Bottom plate

Top Plate | 1
Zip Ties | 4
Battery Clips | 3

Tie the Battery clips to the top plate. One side will have 2 stacked, the other just one.

## Full Assembly
Components  | #
------------- | -------------
Bottom Assembly | 1
Middle Assembly | 1
Top Assembly | 1
4-40 thumb screw 3/8” | 8

Now we mount the Bottom Assembly to the Middle Assembly, and the Middle Assembly to the Top Assembly. Note that **assembly direction matters.** The bottom assembly must be mounted to the middle assembly in such a way that the Motor cables can reach through the slot on the middle plate. The middle plate must be mounted to the top plate in such a way that the ports on the battery are on the same side as the ports of the cape. Also you might find it easier to attach the motor cables before you mount the top assembly. (See next step)

Components  | #
------------- | -------------
Full Assembly | 1
DC power “Y” cable | 1
9” USB-C Cable| 2
Motor Cable | 2

Finally we connect all the cables and power:

1. Use the “Y” Cable to connect the power bank and the Cape
2. Use the USB-C to connect the power bank and the Pi
3. Use the USB-C Cable to connect the Robotics Control Board and Pi

4. Connect the motor cables to the control board. Note that **you will short the cape if you do it backwards.** If you are using the rainbow cables it connects like below:

Wire Color  | Signal
------------- | -------------
Red | Encoder B
Orange | Encoder A
Yellow| 3.3 V
Green | GND
Blue | Motor -
Black | Motor +

# Using the Code

After building upload the mbot.uf2 file to the pico while it is in bootsel mode.

To use the controller with the balance bot, connect the controller via bluetooth to the Pi, and run:

```
python ./python/balance_test_drive.py
```
Control  | Outcome
------------- | -------------
Left Joystick Up-Down | Robot moves forward and back
Right Joystick Left-Right | Robot moves left or right
B| Robot stops
A | Robot restarts

To use the PID Tuner run:

```
python ./python/Controller_Tuner.py
```
| Control  | Outcome |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| + | += .1 gain |
| - | -= .1 gain |
| * | *= 1.1 gain |
| / | /= 1.1 gain |
